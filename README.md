# SAO-MANAGEMENT-PORTAL
## Project Description
The SAO Management Portal efficiently and effectively digitalizes the system of the Student Activities Office for the project beneficiaries; the main beneficiaries of the system are the SAO head, and student leaders, whilst the institution admins are secondary beneficiaries only. This allows the beneficiaries to have an organized process for information and documents such as the Activity Proposal Form, Requisition Form, Liquidation Report, Budget, and other necessary documents and/or information under the mentioned beneficiaries. Moreover, the portal creates a visual aid for the beneficiaries, making it easier for everyone to check the necessary information such as document status, budget status, and important announcements from the SAO head.
